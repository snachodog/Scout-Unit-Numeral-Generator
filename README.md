# Scout Unit Numeral Generator
 A tool for creating images of Troop, Pack, Crew Numerals

This tool that creates "unit numerals" for Scout units.

The flow is the user inputs their unit type (Pack, Troop, or Crew), and then number, (228 or 51) and the tool will put the associated images (5.png, and 1.png) for each numeral next to each other and output a file (Pack 51.jpg).
