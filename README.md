# Scout Unit Numeral Generator
 A tool for creating images of Troop, Pack, Crew Numerals

This tool that creates "unit numerals" for Scout Troops.

The flow is the user inputs their unit number, (228 or 51) and the tool will put the associated images (five.png, and one.png) for each numeral next to each other and output a file (five_one.png).
